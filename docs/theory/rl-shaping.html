<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>VSAVM uses RL as shaping rather than as a replacement for language training. The system often faces multiple plausible candidate programs or response modes. A learned preference can bias selection toward candidates that have historically remained consistent under closure.</p>
<h2>What is optimized</h2>
<p>The action space is intentionally small: selecting among candidate programs, schemas, or response modes. This avoids token-level RL, which is expensive and difficult to audit. Each action corresponds to a semantic decision that can be logged and evaluated.</p>
<h2>Signals and discipline</h2>
<p>Bounded closure naturally provides negative feedback when contradictions are detected. Additional shaping can penalize branching blow-ups and reward compact programs. The resulting preferences steer search toward stable solutions without overriding the explicit consistency gate.</p>
<h2>Trade-offs</h2>
<p>Shaping can overfit to a narrow verifier if the verifier does not reflect the real failure modes. The safe approach is to keep RL as a stability prior while maintaining the correctness guarantee in explicit closure checks and deterministic boundary behavior.</p>
