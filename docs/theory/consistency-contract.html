<p>This page is a theory note. It expands the topic in short chapters and defines terminology without duplicating the formal specification documents.</p><p>The diagram has a transparent background and is intended to be read together with the caption and the sections below.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The consistency contract defines what the system is allowed to emit and under what conditions. It formalizes budgets, closure behavior, and response modes. Without such a contract, the system cannot make honest claims about correctness.</p>
<h2>Budgets and monotonicity</h2>
<p>Budgets include depth, branching, steps, and optionally time. These parameters define exploration coverage and therefore the strength of a conclusion. Increasing budget should not merely increase confidence; it should reveal more consequences and potentially uncover conflicts, making the system more honest rather than more fluent.</p>
<h2>Response modes</h2>
<p>Strict mode emits only what remains consistent across explored branches. Conditional mode emits conclusions tied to explicit assumptions or branches. Indeterminate mode is returned when the system cannot justify a conclusion under the given budget. These modes are semantic commitments that prevent the system from pretending certainty.</p>
<h2>Auditability</h2>
<p>The contract implies logs and metadata: budget used, branches explored, rules applied, and conflicts detected. This allows operational explanations and makes the system testable. It also provides a practical mechanism to debug where and why reasoning fails.</p>
