<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A question is treated as a request to produce an executable query program. The pipeline is explicit to support audit and control: normalization creates a structured span, retrieval proposes candidate schemas, slot filling binds discrete values, and compilation emits a program in the VM instruction set. This transformation operates through a learned pipeline rather than hand-coded rules.</p>

<h2>Natural language to query compilation</h2>
<p>The compilation process follows explicit stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Query normalization</strong>: Convert input text to the standard event stream representation. Identify interrogative markers, entity references, relationship indicators, and logical connectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity identification</strong>: Disambiguate entity mentions (specific individuals, general categories, abstract concepts) using local query context and global knowledge base context. Maintain coreference tracking for pronouns and definite descriptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema retrieval</strong>: Use VSA similarity measures to identify candidate schemas from the library. Hypervector comparison produces a ranked list of potential matches that handle linguistic variations.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema matching</strong>: Evaluate structural compatibility beyond surface similarity. Maintain multiple candidate schemas rather than committing to a single interpretation early.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Slot filling and program instantiation</h2>
<p>Slot filling binds entities, roles, and references using discrete matching and coreference heuristics, augmented by associative retrieval:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direct matching</strong>: Query elements corresponding exactly to schema slots.</li>
  <li><strong>Type-based inference</strong>: Use slot type constraints to identify appropriate elements even with different surface forms.</li>
  <li><strong>Semantic association</strong>: VSA similarity measures identify related elements when direct matching fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complex queries may require multiple schemas combined or nested. The composition system maintains explicit data flow graphs tracking information movement through composite reasoning.</p>
<p>Program instantiation translates filled schemas into executable VM instruction sequences, including optimization steps: common subexpression identification, redundant operation elimination, and operation reordering for cache locality.</p>

<h2>Program search and selection</h2>
<p>The search process explores the space of possible reasoning strategies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Candidate generation</strong>: Modify existing programs by changing parameters, reordering operations, or substituting alternative sub-programs. Learned heuristics guide exploration toward promising directions.</li>
  <li><strong>Population management</strong>: Maintain candidate diversity through mutation and recombination. Use fitness-based selection while preserving potentially valuable less-fit candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>MDL-based scoring</strong>: Minimum Description Length balances performance and simplicity. Score components include complexity (program length/intricacy), accuracy (correct results on test cases), and generality (performance on unseen examples). Computational efficiency is also weighted.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency checking</strong>: Each candidate is evaluated via bounded closure analysis to prevent logical contradictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Beam pruning</strong>: Retain only the most promising candidates at each stage while maintaining diversity to avoid premature convergence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schema learning and consolidation</h2>
<p>The schema learning process discovers recurring patterns in query-program relationships:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong>: Statistical analysis of compilation logs identifies correlations between linguistic patterns and reasoning strategies. Rigorous significance testing ensures genuine regularities.</li>
  <li><strong>Compression-driven emergence</strong>: Schemas providing significant MDL compression are promoted. The analysis evaluates both individual schema benefits and interaction effects with other schemas.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema abstraction</strong>: Hierarchical clustering of similar query-program pairs creates general patterns. Common structure is preserved while varying aspects are parameterized.</li>
  <li><strong>Consolidation triggers</strong>: Conservative criteria require substantial evidence before creating or modifying schemas. Validation on held-out examples ensures generalization beyond training data.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema generalization</strong>: Existing schemas can be extended for new query types through careful analysis of differences from existing patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multimodal query processing</h2>
<p>Queries spanning multiple input modalities require sophisticated coordination:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-modal reference resolution</strong>: Determine when entities in different modalities refer to the same real-world objects. Combine explicit linking (demonstratives, temporal synchronization) with implicit similarity-based association. Maintain uncertainty estimates for correspondence hypotheses.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporal and spatial slot filling</strong>: Resolve absolute and relative temporal references against audio/video timestamps. Align spatial references with coordinate systems and object locations in visual inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Unified execution</strong>: The VM operates seamlessly across different symbolic representations through the canonical fact format. Cross-modal consistency checking accounts for modality-specific error patterns and uncertainty characteristics.</li>
  <li><strong>Modality-specific adaptations</strong>: Learned associations between reasoning strategies and modality characteristics enable optimized strategy selection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing ambiguity</h2>
<p>Instead of forcing a single interpretation, VSAVM carries multiple candidate programs in a beam. Candidates are evaluated by explanatory fit and by early closure checks that detect contradictions. This makes uncertainty explicit and supports conditional outputs when necessary.</p>

<h2>Engineering implications</h2>
<p>Because compilation is explicit, it is testable. You can measure how often a schema is retrieved, how often slot filling is ambiguous, and how often a candidate fails under closure. These metrics can guide consolidation and improve robustness over time.</p>
