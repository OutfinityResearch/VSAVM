# DS012 Geometric interpretation and conceptual spaces

The geometric interpretation treats VM execution as a trajectory in the state space. Concepts are regions defined by canonical facts and stabilizing rules, not points in an embedding space. Reasoning is a constrained traversal of the VM transition graph.

VSA provides an auxiliary similarity geometry for surface forms, offering a rapid projection toward candidate discrete programs. The VM validates those candidates through execution and conflict checks, separating similarity from semantics.

Bounded closure approximates local transitive closure in the state graph, and a larger budget means deeper and wider exploration. Macro programs become consolidated paths that reduce search cost while preserving consistency.
