# DS013 Federated learning potential

Federated learning is natural in the VM plus VSA architecture because learned artifacts are discrete and aggregable. Clients can contribute counters, prototypes, and utility scores rather than raw data. Discrete language statistics can be aggregated with frequency thresholds and optional privacy noise.

VSA prototypes for schemas and macro programs can be merged through bundling and deduplicated via similarity and operational compatibility. A shared library improves over time without forcing complete retraining.

Selection policies can be federated through aggregated utility and risk statistics rather than by sharing raw policies. New rules are admitted only after consistency tests prevent global contamination.
