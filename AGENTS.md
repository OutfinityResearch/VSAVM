# AGENTS

All generated and saved files must be written in English, including documentation, markdown, and code comments. Instructions may arrive in Romanian, but file content must remain English.

## Collaboration and Safety

- Assume other agents/streams may modify files in parallel; avoid broad refactors and keep changes minimal and localized.
- Do not run `git` commands (e.g., `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git blame`, `git checkout`, `git reset`).
